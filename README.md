# AP Agricultural Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing irrigation infrastructure and groundwater conditions across villages in Andhra Pradesh using real-world data from the **6th Minor Irrigation Census – Village Schedule (2017–18)**.  
Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **data visualization** in Python, the project uncovers trends, disparities, and actionable insights for sustainable agricultural and water resource management.

---

## Objectives
- Identify the most common sources of irrigation in Andhra Pradesh villages.
- Assess the distribution and accessibility of irrigation resources.
- Explore the relationship between irrigation sources, cultivated land, and seasonal cropping.
- Examine groundwater availability pre- and post-monsoon.
- Highlight regional disparities and areas needing policy intervention.

## Dataset
**Source:** [data.gov.in – 6th Minor Irrigation Census (Village Schedule)](https://data.gov.in/resource/6th-minor-irrigation-census-village-schedule-andhra-pradesh) 

**Attributes:**  
- **Geographical & Agricultural Data:** cultivable area, net sown area, geographical area.
- **Irrigation Details:** seasonal irrigated areas (Kharif, Rabi, Perennial, Other), net vs gross irrigated area.
- **Groundwater Levels:** pre- and post-monsoon depths.
- **Policy Indicators:** major/medium irrigation schemes, Water Users Associations.
- **Village Classification:** tribal/non-tribal.

---

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation & preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization  
- **Seaborn** – Statistical data visualization

---

## Key Analyses & Visualizations
- **Data Completeness Check** – Handling missing values (e.g., irrigation scheme names).
- **Distribution Analysis** – Net irrigated area across villages.
- **Land Use Patterns** – Cultivable vs irrigated area comparisons.
- **Seasonal Irrigation Trends** – Kharif, Rabi, Perennial irrigation.
- **Net vs Gross Irrigation** – Multi-cropping potential.
- **Groundwater Analysis** – Pre- and post-monsoon levels across districts.
- **Tribal vs Non-Tribal Comparison** – Irrigation access disparities.
- **Correlation Heatmap** – Relationships among numerical features.

---

## Results & Insights
- Irrigation resources are unevenly distributed, with some villages heavily reliant on monsoon rains.
- Large gaps exist between cultivable and irrigated areas in certain districts (e.g., YSR District).
- Kharif season dominates irrigation coverage due to monsoon dependency.
- Groundwater recharge varies significantly between districts, indicating over-extraction in some areas.
- Villages with active **Water Users Associations** often show better irrigation outcomes.
